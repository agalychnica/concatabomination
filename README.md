Rogue taxa can be phylogenetically unstable because of limited and extensive missing data, leading to multiple trees, unresolved consensus topologies and an increase in run times. “Concatabominations” was developed as a heuristic extension to the Safe Taxonomic Reduction (STR) method ([Wilkinson 1995](http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/44/4/501.short)) that identifies unstable taxa. Our method is based on the experimental merging of data from pairs of “potential taxonomic equivalents” to create new “concatabominated” taxa (conceptually equivalent to forcing taxa together in a tree). Taxa that can be combined with many others without introducing additional homoplasy to the data (tested by means of compatibility) are candidate rogue taxa. Our pipeline implementation allows visualisation of taxonomic equivalence relations as a network.
